We need on-site Bückeburg archives research done.

Put togehter the further reaseach needed. Be sure I have a complete list of individuals.:
Determine the recorded events needed--marriage, confirmation, baptism--and its Nachträge

== Outline of Analysis

The residence is no. 19 Evesen is given for two daughter's marriages:

* xref:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[1816 Christine Louise Krückeberg Marriage]
* xref:petzen-band2-image348.adoc[1822 Philippine Louise Eleonore Krückeberg Marriage]

In the 1816 marriage of daughter Christine Louise Eleonore, there is an addenda that gives her
birthday and death date. Her birth record likewise contains an addendaq that gives the data for marriage. These two
records  cross refence easch other, anmd the information in common between the records is consistent. todo: list
it. 

The baptism records include the identity of the mother.

In the other records we can use the age given to determine the approximate birth year and examine the birth records to
see if they too reveal the name of the mother.

Todo:Write that analysis up here.

TODO: Mention we have the negative evidence that there are no other records and since we have conscientiously searched all
records involving the surname Krückeberg we can rule out that there were no other children baptized in the Petzen
church for this couple.

Mention the steinbergen birth and the fact that it has no birth record in the Steinbergen  church.

== Write up a explanation and the significance of the Nachträge.

==== The Nachträge Breadcrumbs Trail

Some church records contain addenda (Nachtrage in German) that reference other church records for the same individual.
In the the example below, excerpted from a marriage record, the first two column describe the groom and bride. After
listing their names, their father's names, their residences, ages and religion, each
ends with two dates: their *get.*, short for *getauft*, baptism date; followed by the date of  *gest.*,
short for *gestorben*  death/burial.

image::nachtrag_example.jpg[link=self]

These addendum (Nachträge) identity the same individual in the records they cross reference by date. One does not
have to infer the individual's identity. The Nachtrage confirms it for you.

== Christine Louise Krückeberg Marriage

The most recent church record for a Krückeberg in the "Verzeichnis der Getauften, Konfirmierten,
Getrauten und Gestorbenen 1785-1827" that contains Nachtragis is the December 1, 1816, xref:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[marriage
of Christine Louise Krückeberg].  At some point, Christine Louise Krückeberg's December 1, 1816, marriage
record was supplemented with her birth-baptism date and after her death with her death date. 

From the column *"Name, Religion, Geburt und Wohnort der Brat"* (Name, Religion, Birth and Place of Residence of the Bride),
we learn this:

[quote, "Name, Religion, Geburt und Wohnort der Brat"] 
____
Jungfrau Christine Louise Krückebergs, des verstorbenen Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen
hinterlassene eheliche Tochter. Luth. Conf. u. jetzt 19. Jahr alt. 
____

This grammatical breakdown explains how the German should be rephrased in English:

. Main subject: 

+
*"Jungfrau Christine Louise Krückebergs"* +
→ “Maiden Christine Louise Krückebergs”
+
* The *-s* on Krückebergs is not possessive, but likely a *dialectal/feminine marker*.
. Appositive genitive(possesive) phrase:

+
*"des verstorbenen Johann Heinrich Krückeberg n. 19 in Evesen hinterlassene eheliche Tochter"* +
→ “legitimate surviving daughter of the deceased Johann Heinrich Krückeberg of No. 19 in Evesen”

This *entire genitive phrase* modifies and explains *who Christine Louise is* — she is the *daughter* of this man.

We can now express it in English:

[quote, English rephrasing]
____
Christine Louise Krückeberg, an unmarried woman [alternately, virgin], [is] the legitimate surviving daughter
of the late Johann Heinrich Krückeberg of No. 19 in Evesen.
____

Notice also that the bride's address is given in terms of her late father's address.

While the phrase *"n. 19 in Evesen"* grammatically refers to the father,
because it appears under the column for *"Wohnort der Brat"* (residence of the
bride), and no other residence is given, it is certainly meant to indicate that
Christine Louise currently lives at No. 19 in Evesen, even if described
indirectly through her father's former home.

This style is used repeatedlly in the Petzen marriage records: individuals are identified
by their household and using the father’s name and house number to define the residence. 

This table summarizes the family information found in her marriage record:

The birth Nachtrage (addendum) gives Christine Louise's birth/baptism date as
on April 26, 1798]. Only one xref:petzen-band2-image71.adoc[Christine Louise
Kückeberg was baptized] in the Petzen church on that date. Her birth record, likewise,
was later supplemented with her marriage date, December 1, 1816. This independently
confirms the marriage and birth records refer to the same person.

Her birth-and-baptism record also gives her family's residence as "no. 19
Evesen". Since it also provides her mother's namem, we now have these cumulative family
group details:

A xref:petzen-band2-image207-2.adoc[confirmation record] for Christine Louise Krückeberg
is found around the expected date of her 13^th^ or 14^th^ birthday, on April 7, 1811, when she was three
and a half weeks shy of 13 years old. Her identity is confirmed by matching the information
given for her parent's names, her birthdate and the families current residence with the same

Her mother's given name's differ slightly between these two records: "Anne Sophie Kromer" vs "Kathar[ine] Sophie Krömer".
The xref:petzen-band2-image5-1.adoc[marriage record] of her parent's resolves this discrepancy. TODO explain that
marriage record has all her given names. But put the explanation after adding children below.

.Negative Evidence
****
What is negative evidence?
**Negative Evidence**

**Definition:** Negative evidence arises when the absence of a record where one would be expected becomes evidence
in itself.

In my case:

All the Petzen 1795-1827 Kirchenbuch records have been thoroughly examined for Krückeberg records, which have been
transliterated and translated and are at https://docs.krueceberg.org.

If no additional daughters of Johann Heinrich Krückeberg appear in the records where you would reasonably expect
them—such as in baptisms, confirmations, or marriages—then their absence is informative.

This absence becomes negative evidence that there were no other daughters born or raised in the parish during that time period.

Note: Negative evidence is not the same as a lack of evidence. It's not simply “nothing was found,” but rather “nothing was
found where something would be expected." If there where further daughters, then there would be a baptism-birth record.
****

One daughter was born in Steinbergen.

*Outline use after concluding this section that starrted with the Nachtrage for the daughter:*
. next to the marriage of Johann Heinrich and his wife
. then the birth of their daughters who were not born in Steinbergen
. then their confirmations
. then their marriages, using thee outline at top of this page.
sum up: these are all children born/baptized in Petzen.


Heinrich of No. 19 Evesen is the father in a marriage record, and we have found not just marriage, birth and confirmation
(and  death) records involving his name, but all Krückebergs.

Daughters of Johann Heinrich Krückeberg

These birth/baptism records list the father abd mother as follows:

Note: The birth year and place are from her xref:petzen-band2-image27-2.adoc[1812 marriage record Nachtrag].

|Johann Heinrich Krückeberg|Catharine Sophie Krömer|xref:petzen-band2-image82-1.adoc[Sophie Caroline Krückeberg Baptism]|1803|No. 19 Evesen

These confirmation records also provide the identity of both parents of a child.

* xref:petzen-band2-image201.adoc[1806 Philippine Louise Leonore Krückeberg Confirmation]
* xref:petzen-band2-image207-2.adoc[1811 Christine Louise Krückeberg Confirmation]
* xref:petzen-band2-image211-3.adoc[1817 Sophie Caroline Krückeberg Confirmation]

These marriage records identify just one parent, the bride's father, Johann Heinrich Krückeberg of no. 19 Evesen:

* xref:petzen-band2-image339.adoc[1816 Christine Louise Krückeberg Marriage]
* xref:petzen-band2-image348.adoc[1822 Philippine Louise Eleonore Krückeberg Marriage]

Theses recods should have the bride's 1.) father's name and his address, which is also her address since bride's
lived at home until marriage. We can use the bride's age founnd in the marriage record to determine her approximate
birth year, and so locate her birth record. Her birth-baptism records will contain both parent's
names and the family's residence. We will the be able to confirm that the father listed in the marriage record
and living at the address given in the marriage record of his daughter, father his daughter by the
mother listed both on the birth record. 

NOTE: Point out that one daughter was born in Steinbergen.

=== Death Record for Johann Heinrich Krückeberg

In the marriage records for his daughters:

* 1816 Christine Louise Krückeberg Marriage
* 1822 Philippine Louise Eleonore Krückeberg Marriage
* TODO: add  others
 
their address prior to marriasge is given in terms of their father's address. This is true after his death, too, as the
marriage records for his daughter Christine Louise Krückeberg shows: xref:/petzen-band2-image339.adoc[1816 Christine Louise Krückeberg Marriage]

Q: If he died in 1805, why doesn't the xref:petzen-band2-image27-2.adoc[1812 marriage] of Marie Philippine Krückeberg also state this?
