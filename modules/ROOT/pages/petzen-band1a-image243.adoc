== Baptism Record

.Marriage Required Approval
****
[IMPORTANT]
====
Marriage required approval. Marriage was not so much about personal choice or falling love. It was done for maintaining or improving
the family's social and economic status however modest it might be. If a couple could not obtain approval because of their
modest income, they sometimes started a family anyway. This might have been the case here, where the parents marry a month before
their child is born.

.Meaining of Latin "āī huj"
****
[NOTE]
====
**"āī huj"** is an Latin abbreviation, very common in 18th-century German church records.
 
Meaning:

* **"āī"** = anni--the genitive singular of of "annus" (Latin for "year"), with the bar over the "ai"
indicating abbreviation.
* **"huj:"** = huius — Latin for "this" (as in "of this year").

So the full phrase "āī huj" means:

**"of this year"** (literally, "of the year of this").

So

**"...von seiner seit den 15ten Jan: a͞i huj: ihm angetraueten Frau Anna Philippina geb. Rösenern gebohrens
Töchter getaufft."** 

translates as:

**"...by his wife Anna Philippina née Rösener, to whom he had been married since the 15th of January of this year,
was born his daughter, who was baptized."**
