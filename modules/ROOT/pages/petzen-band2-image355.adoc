[NOTE]
====
In 19th-century German church records:

* Individuals were often identified by village and house number associated with the head of household — usually the father.

* This applied to both deceased and living fathers, and often included professions (like "Leibzüchter") or inheritance status
(like "Anerbe").

* Even if the son or daughter still lived at that house, the address is still formally associated with the father in these
records.

.Anerbe Explained
****
[NOTE]
====
The groom is described as the "Sohn u[nd] **Anerbe** des Johann Heinrich Jäger (son an principal heir of Johann Heinrich Jäger)".
**Anerbe** was part of the **Anerbenrecht**:

Anerbenrecht::

"inheritance law keeping farms intact (in northern Germany and old Bavaria)." 

-- from Thode's German-English Genealogical Dictionary

See German wikipedia article on https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anerbenrecht[Anerbenrecht].

Anerbe::

* "principal heir[to a landed estate]; single heir"

* single heir
====

In 1826, in Schaumburg-Lippe, "Anerbe" had a specific legal and social meaning
rooted in German inheritance practices. Here's what it meant in your context:

* Anerbe refers to the designated heir (often the eldest son, but not always) who
inherits the entire farm or family estate.
* This was part of the tradition of Anerbenrecht (hereditary right of
succession), which was common in rural parts of Germany, especially in northern
and central regions like Schaumburg-Lippe.
* Instead of dividing property among all children (which would fragment farms
into uselessly small plots), one heir (the "Anerbe") would inherit the main
estate to keep it intact. Other siblings were typically given monetary
settlements or other smaller arrangements ("Abfindung").
* The Anerbe took on responsibility for supporting aging parents and sometimes
helping siblings until they could establish themselves elsewhere.

If someone is called an "Anerbe," it likely signals
that:

* He was the successor to a farmstead or property.

* He had a certain social and financial standing in the village.

* His status could affect marriage prospects, taxes, and legal responsibilities.
