.Clarifying the information in the 2^nd^ Column.
****
[NOTE]
====
*"Name, Stand, Gewerbe, Geburts u. bisheriger Wohnort des Verstorbenen"* translates as: *"Name, Status,
Occupation, Birthplace and most recent Residence of the Deceased"*:

* Since the wife did not have a *Gewerbe*, an occupation, *Hofmeister(estate manager)*, is her survinging husband's occupation.
* *"Birthplace and most recent Residence of the Deceased"* contains two pieces of information, but only the
deceased's final residence is mentioned. We know from the couple's xref:petzen:petzen-band2-image12-2.adoc[marriage
record] that her village prior to marriage was Meisen, but she may have been born elsewhere.
* *"Reinen-Neelhof"* is the name of a specific estate or farm — essentially a *proper noun*:
** “Hof” → “Estate” or “Farm”
** *"Reinen-Neel* appears to be a compound of two family or place names.

+
So its meaning conveys: *"“on the Reinen-Neel estate (a manor farm)”*
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
*"Einlieger"* in the phrase *"Einlieger beÿ n.13 in Bärenbusch"* most accurately translates to *lodger,
subtenant, or resident without full property ownership*". This implies:

* *Lodger/Subtenant*: This suggests that Philippine Dorothee Krückeberg and her husband were not the
primary owners or renters of the entire property at #13 in Bärenbusch. Instead, they were likely
renting a part of a dwelling or living within a household that belonged to someone else.
* *Resident without full property ownership*: In rural German society of the early 19th century,
land and property ownership were crucial. "Einlieger" often referred to individuals or families
who lived in a house or on a farm owned by someone else. They might have paid rent in money or in
labor, or they might have been "living in" as hired hands or with family.

This distinction was important in historical records as it provided information about the social
and economic standing of individuals. While her husband was a former "Hofmeister" (which could
mean a steward or majordomo on an estate), by 1819, they were living as "Einlieger," indicating
a different living arrangement, possibly a more humble one.
