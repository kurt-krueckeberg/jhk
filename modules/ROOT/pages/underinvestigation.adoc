= Early Krückeberg and Bleeke Records from Petzen

These are the earliest baptism records from Petzen for the Bleekes and one for "Kückeberg".
These images are from the Petzen Kirchenbuch, not Frille. But since so much effort is involved
enhancing the often very faded images, and since they are hard to transliterate, I'm not sure
it is worth the effort.
