[NOTE]
====
In 19th-century German church records:

* Individuals were often identified by village and house number associated with the head of household — usually the father.

* This applied to both deceased and living fathers, and often included professions (like "Leibzüchter") or inheritance status
(like "Anerbe").

* Even if the son or daughter still lived at that house, the address is still formally associated with the father in these
records.

.Comments on German words used in this entry
====
* **hinterlassen** -- is a verb meaning: to leave something to somebody, to bequesth something, to leave somebody a legacy of
something; to leave hind. As an adjective is can mean "bereaved" or "survivor (of someone deceased)". **hinterlassener** would
be the adjective form used for a male survior: ein hinterlassener Sohn (a surviving son).

* **Anerbe** -- is defined in link:https://www.dict.cc/?s=Anerbe[dict.cc] as: 
** principal heir[to a landed estate]
** single heir.
+
**Anerbe** comes from **Anerbenrecht**, which is:
+
"inheritance law keeping farms intact (in northern Germany and old Bavaria)." -- from Thode's German-English Genealogical Dictionary
+
Chatgpt explained how **Anerbenrecht** operated in Schaumburg-Lippe:

[quote]
____
In 1826, in Schaumburg-Lippe, "Anerbe" had a specific legal and social meaning
rooted in German inheritance practices. Here's what it meant in your context:

* Anerbe refers to the designated heir (often the eldest son, but not always) who
inherits the entire farm or family estate.
* This was part of the tradition of Anerbenrecht (hereditary right of
succession), which was common in rural parts of Germany, especially in northern
and central regions like Schaumburg-Lippe.
* Instead of dividing property among all children (which would fragment farms
into uselessly small plots), one heir (the "Anerbe") would inherit the main
estate to keep it intact. Other siblings were typically given monetary
settlements or other smaller arrangements ("Abfindung").
* The Anerbe took on responsibility for supporting aging parents and sometimes
helping siblings until they could establish themselves elsewhere.

In a Kirchenbuch entry, if someone is called an "Anerbe," it likely signals
that:

* He was the successor to a farmstead or property.
* He had a certain social and financial standing in the village.
* His status could affect marriage prospects, taxes, and legal responsibilities.
____
+
* **Benner** -- Thode's defines this as: cooper.
* **Leibzüchtner**(male)/**Leibzüchtnerin**(female) -- Thode's definition is: "person on life estate". He defines Leibzucht as: "life annuity; pension; life estate".
