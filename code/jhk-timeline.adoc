[NOTE]
====
In 19th-century German church records:

* Individuals were often identified by village and house number associated with the head of household — usually the father.

* This applied to both deceased and living fathers, and often included professions (like "Leibzüchter") or inheritance status
(like "Anerbe").

* Even if the son or daughter still lived at that house, the address is still formally associated with the father in these
records.

.What was a Taglöhner?
****
[NOTE]
====
A **Taglöhner** was an agricultural laborer who was paid on a daily basis, who likely worked
under a contract.
====

This was a very common status in rural German territories like Schaumburg-Lippe,
especially during population growth in the early 1800s, when there were too many
people and too little land to go around.

.What is a Leibzüchter?
****
[NOTE]
====
The term **„Leibzüchter“** is an old and regionally specific German term, particularly used in areas
like Schaumburg-Lippe, that refers to a retired farmer who retains a life estate on a farm--someone
who has passed the working operation of the farm to a successor (usually a son) but continues to
live on the farm with guaranteed rights.

**Literal Breakdown**

* Leib = body (here meaning “for life”)

* Züchter = from ziehen, meaning “to cultivate,” “to rear,” or “to manage”

So, **“Leibzüchter”** literally means **“one who cultivates or resides for life”**, but idiomatically
it refers to a **retired farmer with lifelong residence rights.**

**Precise English Translations**

Depending on context, you could translate Leibzüchter as:

* “Retired farmer with life tenancy”

* “Life tenant farmer”

* “Former farm owner with lifelong residence rights”

* “Retired cultivator under a life estate”
====

**Historical and Legal Context**

In traditional German rural inheritance customs, especially under Anerbenrecht,
the farm was passed on intact to a single heir (the Anerbe). The parents would:

* Transfer ownership of the farm, and

* Retain the right to live on the property (often in a secondary house or part of the main house),

* Receive support (e.g. food, firewood, clothing, care), as laid out in a Leibgeding (a written contract of lifelong support).

A **Leibzüchter** was typically the father who had formally transferred the farm and now lived under the terms of the Leibgeding.
